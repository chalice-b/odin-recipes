        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <div class="center recipe">
            <ol>
                <li>Place chicken breasts between 2 sheets of heavy plastic on a solid,
                    level surface. Firmly pound chicken breasts with the smooth side of a 
                    meat mallet to a 1/2 inch thickness.
                </li>
                <li>Season both sides of chicken breasts with cayenne, salt and black pepper.</li>
                <li>Dredge lightly in flour and shake off any excess.</li>
                <li>Heat olive oil in a skillet over medium-high heat. Place chicken in the pan,
                    reduce heat to medium and cook until browned and cooked through, about 5 minutes 
                    per side; remove to a plate.
                </li>
                <li>Cook capers in reserved oil, smashing them lightly to release brine, for about 
                    30 seconds.
                </li>
                <li>Pour white wine into the skillet and bring to a boil while scraping the browned
                    bits of food off the bottom of the pan with a wooden spoon. Cook until reduced by
                    half, about 2 minutes.
                </li>
                <li>Stir lemon juice, water, and butter into the reduced wine mixture.</li>
                <li>Cook and stir continuously to form a thick sauce, for about 2 minutes.
                    Reduce heat to low and stir parsley through the sauce.
                </li>
                <li>Return chicken breasts to pan and cook until heated through, about 1 to 2
                    minutes. Serve with sauce spooned over the top.
                </li>
            </ol>
